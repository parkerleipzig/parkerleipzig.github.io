    <p>Roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon. Sweet tangy, caramelized, and savory all in one dish.</p>
    <p>This super easy dish is a must-have in your repertoire. Delicious all year round, with the upcoming holiday
        season just around the corner, this side dish is perfect for small to large gatherings. Originally from
        Brussels, Belgium as the name implies, they are part of the cabbages family. Rich in minerals, antioxidants as
        well as high in fiber. Rich in vitamin K, A, C, and folate.</p>
    <p>Roasting the sprouts will help to eliminate some of the bitterness as it is counterbalanced with the fat from
        either the olive oil or in this instance, as well as bacon, rendering them full of flavor. Always baked on a
        very hot oven, 400F and above. Do pay attention as not to overburn some of the smaller outer leave.</p>
    <p>Turning once during baking will unify the cooking process as well as giving them a well-round golden color.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Brussels Sprouts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds Brussels Sprouts washed and dried</li>
        <li>4 thick bacon slices thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves finely chopped</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic glaze or more to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Balsamic Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <h3>For the Balsamic Glaze</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat balsamic vinegar and sugar in a small pot or saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to medium-low heat and let simmmer, stirring occasionally until the
            vinegar thickens and is reduced to about 1/2 cup (about 20 minutes). It should be thick enough to coat the
            back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool completely before serving. If too thick, reheat gently for a few seconds
            over the stove.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For the Brussels Sprouts</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.</li>
        <li>Trim the ends of sprouts and cut them in half lengthwise.</li>
        <li>Arrange brussels sprouts, any loose leaves, bacon, and garlic on the baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil
            and toss to well cover all the sprouts. Season generously with salt and pepper. Spread mixture in a single
            layer.</li>
        <li>Roast the Brussels sprouts, turning once through cooking, until tender with charred edges around 20 to 25
            minutes depending on your oven, be careful not to overcook them or burning the leaves.</li>
        <li>In a bowl toss the sprouts with the balsamic vinegar. Adjust taste with extra salt and pepper, if needed.
        </li>
    </ol>
