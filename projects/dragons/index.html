        <h2>What is a Dragon?</h2>
            <p>A dragon is a snake-like legendary creature that appears in folklore of many cultures around the world. Beliefs
            about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have
            often been depicited as winged, horned, four-legged and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in eastern culutures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.</p>
