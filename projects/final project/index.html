<h1>COVID Testing Data at UMD</h1>
<div class="row container">
<div class="col-md-8"> 
<p>The University of Maryland has come a long way from the beginning of the pandemic on March 13, 2020. It started as chaos, with students being kicked off campus and forced to move out of their residences halfway through the spring semester.</p>

<p>The university started officially tracking the covid cases of students, staff and faculty since the smaller population returned to campus in August 2020. Those that came to campus were required to be tested no earlier than 14 days before their arrival but did not require the same test necessary for anyone who had the virus within three months before returning to campus.</p>

<p>Testing became widely available on-campus and students had to get tested bi-weekly to maintain their health status and remain at the university and use its facilities.</p>

<p>To track the positivity rate of students on-campus, the university uses the tests required from the university, as well as tests students took and submitted from outside testing centers, and began being accountable with how well the university and students stayed safe by uploading these results to the covid-19 dashboard that is still updated with recent results even as the landscape of covid changed with testing not required anymore, masks only have to be worn in classrooms and 98% of the campus being fully vaccinated.</p>

<p>The Diamondback has tracked the data as well and using that data there is a chart to display how the covid positivity rate changed on-campus from August 2020 to May 2021.</p>

        <p class= "caption">Chart tacking the positive cases at UMD from August 2020 to May 2021</p>
    </div>
    </div>

<p>There are many things that can account for the errors in this data, such as times when no one got tested as they were home for a holiday or break or when towards the end of the spring semester of 2021, students began to get vaccinated.</p>

<p>Dr. Donald Milton, professor of environmental and occupational health at the UMD Institute of Applied Environmental Health School of Public Health, has been the primary investigator of the UMD StopCOVID Study since its creation in January 2020, long before this country’s reaction to the virus’ invasion.</p>

<p>“We knew that people were coming back to campus from areas where the pandemic has started,” Milton said. “We work to find out if they brought the virus back with them and try and ‘nip it in the bud’, but we did not do that.”</p>

<p>Milton and his team collected breath samples from people with SARS Covid-2 beginning in June 2020 and has been continuing in that method to the present day. By using breath samples, they have been studying the role of aerosols in the transmission of covid and analyzing whether people have antibodies, all while seeing how this has been affected in people with the vaccine and/or booster shot, according to Milton.</p>

<p>Though Milton has been testing some on-campus individuals, he is not responsible for the UMD covid dashboard and is not always confident in his or the university’s numbers.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that our numbers necessarily accurately reflect numbers on-campus and clearly when there’s more covid around we’re collecting more samples,” he said.</p>

<p>Milton also said that the campus dashboard has limitations in giving you a general idea of the trend and peaks of cases, but does not always accurately show the numbers of all students on campus, even though it was a smaller number in fall 2020.</p>

<p>He said the 2021-2022 school year has seen a lower level of positive cases because of the university’s high vaccination rate, but this semester more numbers might be seen because the immunity from the vaccine and/or past covid antibodies might have left people’s bodies completely, in addition to new variants springing about.</p>

<p>The numbers may not have been the most accurate, but show instances on-campus where students may have not taken the virus as seriously, or peaks from when students returned from places and brought the virus back to campus, and those outside events can better explain the peaks shown.</p>
