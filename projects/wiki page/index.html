        <p>It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a
            pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent
            competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a
            guide dog. The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late
            nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further
            infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in
            1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.</p>

        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>The Golden Retriever is a powerfully built, medium-sized breed of dog. The Golden Retriever has a broad head
            with a well-defined stop, with dark eyes set well apart, a wide and powerful muzzle, a large black nose,
            dark-pigmented and slightly drooping flews, and ears of moderate size set high and hanging with a slight
            fold. The neck is muscular and fairly long with loose-fitting skin, the
            shoulders well laid-back and long-bladed, and the body deep through the chest with well-sprung ribs. The
            back is usually level from withers to croup and the long, straight tail is usually carried flat, roughly in
            line with the back. The forelegs are straight with good bone, the hind legs are powerful with well bent
            stifles and muscular thighs, and the feet are cat-like.</p>

        <p>The double coat is a recognisable and striking feature:the outer coat is long, flat or wavy and has good
            feathering on the forelegs, while the undercoat is dense and provides weather resistance. The coat can be
            any shade of cream, yellow or gold; the coat typically becomes paler with age. The Kennel Club breed
            standard prohibits red or mahogany-coloured coats, but a few white hairs on the chest are permitted.
            Originally only yellow or golden coloured examples were permitted, this excluded many outstanding cream
            coloured dogs; to overcome this in 1936 the Kennel Club's standard was amended to include the cream colour.
            The cream colour, which in more modern times can be almost white, has become the dominant colour and is
            particularly favoured by conformation show exhibitors. Golden Retrievers that are bred for conformation
            shows tend to have longer and finer coats than those bred for working as gundogs.</p>

        <p>The Kennel Club breed standard is accepted by every kennel club in the world except those of Canada and the
            United States. Breed standards in North America call for a slightly taller dog and the cream colour is not
            permitted.</p>

        <h2>Temperament</h2>
        <p>The Golden Retriever is considered an intelligent, gentle natured and very affectionate breed of dog. As is
            typical with retriever breeds, the breed is generally calm and biddable, being very easy to train and
            extremely keen to please their master. The breed is known to make excellent pets and family dogs, being
            generally extremely tolerant of children and keen to accompany any member of the family in a range of
            activities. Due to their affable natures, the breed is often completely devoid of guarding instincts. The
            breed usually retains many of their gundog traits and instincts including an excellent sense of smell and a
            strong instinct to retrieve; even among those not trained as gundogs it is typical for Golden Retrievers to
            present their owners with toys or other objects. Compared to other retriever breeds the Golden Retriever is
            typically quite slow to mature.</p>
